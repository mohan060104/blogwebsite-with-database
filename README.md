# blogwebsite-with-database

The blog-with-database project is a personal blogging platform where we can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It uses MongoDB as its database to store blog posts.

The project is built with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and uses EJS for server-side rendering of HTML.

The .env file contains the connection string for the MongoDB database. The connection string includes the username, password, and URL of the MongoDB Atlas cluster where the database is hosted.

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, with separate files for models, views, and controllers. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Overall, the blog-with-database project is a full-featured blogging platform with CRUD operations for blog posts, and a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.
